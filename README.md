## 🎮 Interactive AI Projects

### 1. Snake AI with NEAT and Q-Learning
- Classic Snake game implementation with AI
- Uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) and Q-Learning algorithms
- Watch the AI learn and improve its gameplay through reinforcement learning
- [Try it here](https://naveenda.github.io/games/snake-ai)

### 2. Flappy Bird AI with NEAT
- Flappy Bird game with AI implementation
- Uses NEAT algorithm for neural network evolution
- Demonstrates natural selection and adaptation in AI
- [Try it here](https://naveenda.github.io/games/flappy-bird-ai)
