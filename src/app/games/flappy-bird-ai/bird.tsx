# How NEAT Learns to Play Flappy Bird
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a powerful algorithm that evolves neural networks using principles inspired by natural selection. In our Flappy Bird AI, NEAT helps a population of birds learn to play the gameâ€”without any hardcoded rules!

## The NEAT Evolution Cycle
Let's break down how NEAT works in this project:

### Initialization:
We start with a population of birds, each controlled by a randomly initialized neural network.
Simulation:
All birds play the game at the same time. Each bird receives information about its environment (like distance to pipes and its velocity) and decides whether to jump or do nothing.
Evaluation:
Birds are rewarded for surviving longer (time survived) and penalized for dying. The longer a bird stays alive, the higher its fitness.
Selection & Reproduction:
After all birds die, the best-performing networks are selected. These "elite" networks are copied, mutated, and sometimes combined to form a new generation.
Repeat:
The process repeats for many generations, with each new population getting better at playing the game.

## Why NEAT Works for Flappy Bird
- No hardcoded rules: The AI learns by trial and error, not by being told how to play.
- Generalization: By facing random pipe positions, the AI learns a robust strategy that works in many situations.
- Continuous improvement: Each generation gets a little better, evolving smarter and more complex neural networks.
