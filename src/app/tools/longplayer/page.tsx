                <p className="mb-4">
                    A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon something surreal while
                    walking through Trinity Buoy Wharf in London â€” a calm,
                    ambient drone filling a quiet lighthouse space. I soon
                    learned I was listening to{" "}
                    <strong>Longplayer</strong>: a piece of generative music
                    designed to play for <em>1,000 years</em>{" "}
                    without repeating. That blew my mind.

                    What is Longplayer?
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Longplayer was created by Jem Finer in 1999. It's a
                    generative composition built from six short recordings of
                    Tibetan singing bowls. The magic lies in how these loops are
                    layered and time-shifted so they interact differently over
                    time. It started playing on January 1, 2000 and is intended
                    to continue â€” without repetition â€” until December 31, 2999.

                    Why I Found It Fascinating
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    As a developer who enjoys generative systems, this felt like
                    music-meets-systems design at an epic scale. The system
                    doesn't store a 1,000-year-long file. Instead, it uses time
                    â€” yes, real time â€” to determine exactly what should be
                    playing at any given moment.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    What makes it even more interesting: if power is lost,
                    Longplayer resumes exactly where it should be based on the
                    clock. It's not sound that's being saved, but the logic.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
                    Recreating It As a Developer
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    That got me thinking: could I simulate this? My goal wasn't
                    to copy the full system, but to build a simplified,
                    time-synced ambient engine that layers loops in a similar
                    way. I chose <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
                    <strong>Tone.js</strong>{" "}
                    for clean state control and fine-grained audio timing.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    The demo linked above is a small homage. It runs in the
                    browser, uses the system clock to determine playback
                    positions, and aims to give a glimpse of what a generative
                    system feels like when built around real time.

                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    I'm thinking about adding spatial sound positioning
                    (multi-speaker simulation), time zone syncing, and even
                    remote shared sessions. There's something poetic in the idea
                    that a piece of code can run with the elegance of a musical
                    composition.
